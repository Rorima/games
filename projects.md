# Projects
These are my HTML/CSS/JS projects. I'm trying to build fun things and learn more.

## Pop the circles

A circle appears in a random place of the screen and the user has to click on it. The circle reappears in another random place.

If possible, try to time how long it takes for the user to click ten, twenty or thirty circles.

If possible, play a satisfying popping sound when the circle is clicked.

If possible, make the circle appear not too close to the last circle.

## Investing:
Investing on the left side;
Money making in the center;
Buying on the right side;

### Investing part
You can invest in funds which will give you a very little amount of money each second. Each second their dividend value changes randomly.

### Money making
You can make money by clicking on the screen. You can only make one cent per click.

### Donation
You can buy food, clothing and donate them to the poor. Keep track of how much the user has donated.

## Counter v2:
Maybe a heart instead of a square. An animation for each click, and maybe a satisfying sound too. A different sound when the user is awarded with a title.
